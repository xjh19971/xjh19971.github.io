# About		

I am a Master Student of Computer Science at Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University. Prior to this, I got my Bachelor Degree of Engineering at Deparment of Automation, University of Science and Technology Beijing, in 2019.

# Research Interests

**Computer Vision**, **Deep reinforcement learning**, **Multi-view perception**

My current research are focused on reinforcement learning method for autonomous driving policy(**[Link](https://github.com/Atcold/pytorch-PPUU)**).

Besides, I am interested in using GNN to improve the performance of multiple tasks with multi-view cameras.
