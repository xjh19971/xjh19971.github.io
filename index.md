# About		

I am a Master student of Computer Science at Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University. Prior to this, I got Bachelor of Engineering at Deparment of Automation, University of Science and Technology Beijing, in 2019.

# Research Interest

My research interest focuse on **Computer Vision**, **Pose Estimation**, **Reinforcement Learning on Robot Control**. Currently I am exploring on keypoint-based RL on Robot Control. Besides, I am inspired by my past research to use NNs to establish associative relationships between multiple objects.
