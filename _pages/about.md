## Introduction

My name is **Jiuhong Xiao**. I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. at the [Agile Robotics and Perception Lab (ARPL)](https://wp.nyu.edu/arpl/){:target="_blank"}, Tandon School of Engineering, New York University, under the guidance of [Prof. Giuseppe Loianno](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/giuseppe-loianno){:target="_blank"}. My research focuses on developing advanced algorithms for **robotic perception and localization**, with the focus on **multi-modal image alignment** with **retrieval-based** and **homography-based** methods.

I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science from **New York University**. In the summer of 2020, I worked as a research assistant under **Prof. Alfredo Canziani** and **Prof. Yann LeCun**, focusing on autonomous driving perception and control projects. After graduating with my master's degree, I joined **Amazon** as an applied scientist, where I contributed to the development of the [Just Walk Out (JWO)](https://www.justwalkout.com/){:target="_blank"} technology.

Prior to that, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Engineering from the **Department of Automation** at **the University of Science and Technology Beijing**. In my final undergraduate year, I served as a research assistant at the [Intelligent Biomimetic Design Laboratory (IBDLab)](http://en.ibdl.pku.edu.cn/){:target="_blank"}, **Peking University**, working on my undergraduate thesis.
