My name is Jiuhong Xiao. I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. at the [Agile Robotics and Perception Lab (ARPL)](https://wp.nyu.edu/arpl/){:target="_blank"}, Tandon School of Engineering, New York University, under the guidance of [Prof. Giuseppe Loianno](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/giuseppe-loianno){:target="_blank"}. My research focuses on addressing the challenges of **multi-modal image alignment** for the applications on **robotic perception and localization** systems.

I hold a master's degree in Computer Science from New York University. In the summer of 2020, I worked as a research assistant under [Prof. Alfredo Canziani](https://atcold.github.io/){:target="_blank"} and [Prof. Yann LeCun](https://yann.lecun.com/){:target="_blank"}, focusing on autonomous driving perception and control projects. After graduating with my master's degree, I joined Amazon as an applied scientist, where I contributed to the development of the [Just Walk Out (JWO)](https://www.justwalkout.com/){:target="_blank"} technology.

Prior to that, I earned my bachelor's degree in Engineering from the Department of Automation at the University of Science and Technology Beijing. In my final undergraduate year, I served as a research assistant at the [Intelligent Biomimetic Design Laboratory (IBDLab)](http://en.ibdl.pku.edu.cn/){:target="_blank"}, Peking University, working on my undergraduate thesis.

Multi-modal image alignment is critical for UAV thermal geo-localization, especially in nighttime scenarios where GPS may be unavailable. Our research focuses on aligning onboard thermal imagery with reference satellite maps, leveraging techniques such as image matching, homography-based alignment, and uncertainty estimation. These approaches enable real-time, robust localization across a wide range of challenging environments even trained with limited multi-modal paired data.
