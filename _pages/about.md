My name is Jiuhong Xiao. I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. at [Agile Robotics and Perception Lab (ARPL)](https://wp.nyu.edu/arpl/), Tandon School of Engineering, New York University, with my advisor, Prof. [Giuseppe Loianno](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/giuseppe-loianno). 

Prior to this, I got my Master Degree of Computer Science at New York University. After master graduation, I worked as an applied scientist in Amazon for nine months, focusing on [Just Walk Out (JWO)](https://www.justwalkout.com/) Technology.

Before coming to the US, I got my Bachelor Degree of Engineering at Department of Automation at University of Science and Technology Beijing.
