My name is Jiuhong Xiao. I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. at [Agile Robotics and Perception Lab (ARPL)](https://wp.nyu.edu/arpl/), Tandon School of Engineering, New York University, guided by Prof. [Giuseppe Loianno](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/giuseppe-loianno). 

I hold a Master's Degree in Computer Science from New York University. After master graduation, I joined Amazon as an applied scientist, where I contributed to the development of the [Just Walk Out (JWO)](https://www.justwalkout.com/) Technology for a period of nine months.

Prior to this, I completed my Bachelor's Degree in Engineering from the Department of Automation at the University of Science and Technology Beijing.
